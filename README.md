# OpenKarlson
** For Educational Purposes only **

I decided I wanted to make an open source version of Dani's Karlson game. The original game can be downloaded on itch here" https://danidev.itch.io/karlson. Dani posts videos on his channel, Dani, here: https://www.youtube.com/c/DaniDev. In order to decompile the game i used UtinyRipper (can be downloaded here: https://github.com/mafaca/UtinyRipper). The scripts were messed up and nothing worked so i've been working to get them to function. I hope to add modding support (maps, weapons, materials) in the future, though the short term plan is just to get a functioning game. Currently the tutorial level is the only functioning level ,though this will be changed in the future

<h1> How to use: </h1>
Fownload the unity project > extract it somewhere safe > go to unity hub > press the add button > select the extracted folder > set the version 2020.1.4f1 (other versions might work but i cant guarantee it.) > and open it
